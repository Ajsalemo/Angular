# Angular

This was based off the Chrome Extension, Momentum Dash - https://momentumdash.com/ - all credit goes to Momentum Dash

This was created in mind to play around with Angular and other technologies and using Momentum Dash as an approach. This project still needs additional polishing(UI, UX, etc.).

Note: Currently the application is hosted on a free plan, which after some idle time shuts the web process down - after a first hit to the site the Image(s) will need to be re-pulled on Azure,
so a HTTP 502 might appear(due to the time it takes) - refreshing will resolve this. Feel free to clone and run locally, environment variables will need to be added.

## Customization

### The sliders in the menu give the option to hide or show certain parts of the UI, this can be done with or without a logged in account.
### Further, you can choose from a number of photos for a custom background image - if none is chosen, the background image changes every 24 hours.
### This can be done with or without a logged in account.
